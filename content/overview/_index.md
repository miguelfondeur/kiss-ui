  Native UI is not a framework. It's a collection of frontend UI recipes for building accessible, performant and responsive web pages. We do this by focussing on 
  semantic markup and utilitzing what the web platform already gives us. Why reinvent the wheel? Native UI is also built with progressive inhancement in mind. Start Simple and build your way up. Our HTML library is only #kb because we add a very thin yet maticulous layer of CSS for styling over the HTML. We also add some Javascript as a progressive enhancement to HTML. This means, your site WILL run without front-end JS. Of course, you can add your own code but Native UI serves a well formatted starting point to your project. We've also added support for the Hugo Static Site Generator, and native Javascript Web Components. Why we love Hugo. It's fast. It provides ways of code splitting and adding dynamic functionality to your HTML. Why we love Javascript Components. Most modern websites use some kind of frontend framework, Vue, Angular, React. Unfortuantely each framework has it's own set of baggage. Web Components can be shared accross any developer environment and work very closely to framework components while delevering much less code to the frontend. The beauty of Native UI is that as the web platform grows our library will also grow and add new features.
